# Caesar Cipher

### Author: Jeanine NISHIMWE

## About
Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.

## Encoding Function
Enter a message to encode (only alphabets and no space)
Enter a key [1-25]
Saves Encoded Message to file "Encoded_Message.txt"
## Decoding Function
Enter file with correct format and message
Enter key shift [1-25]
Saves Decoded message to file "Decoded_Message.txt"
## File Format For Decoding
When using a personal file for decoding a message the following must be followed :

single line file with message
message only has characters (No space , no numbers or symbols)
The file is in .txt format

## Languages used
*Java

## Expected Output when you run the App and the test
You can access them in folder called Test photo
